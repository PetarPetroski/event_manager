## Reflection:

Tackling the Event Manager assignment was a journey that both surprised and challenged me. Initially, I underestimated the complexity of the task, expecting it to be more straightforward. However, as I delved deeper into the codebase and engaged with the assignment requirements, I realized the intricacies involved in identifying small errors or areas for improvement within a large-scale project. This process was a significant learning experience as it required not only technical skills but also a keen eye for detail and the ability to think critically about software design and functionality.

Through our class discussions and lessons, I was able to apply the concepts and techniques learned to my QA work for this assignment. This practical application of knowledge reinforced my understanding of the material and highlighted the importance of thorough testing and documentation in software development. Connecting these improvements to GitHub Issues allowed me to track and manage the changes effectively, enhancing my collaborative skills and familiarity with industry-standard tools.

Overall, this assignment has been instrumental in honing my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail, which are invaluable traits in the competitive job market. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on such a challenging project and look forward to continuing to grow my skills and expand my knowledge through future assignments.
